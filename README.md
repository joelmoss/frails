# Frails == Modern Front End on Rails

Frails is a modern asset pipeline for [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), built on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Its aims are:

  - Follow convention over configuration as much as possible.
  - Tight integration with Rails, without tying you up in knots.
  - Full Webpack control without fighting with the likes of Webpacker.
  - Embrace modern front end practises.

## Installation

Frails is designed to work only within a Rails application, so must be installed in an existing Rails app. It also requires Node.js and a valid `package.json` file in your app root.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'frails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Then run the installer:

    $ bin/rails frails:install

## Usage

Frails tries to keep as close as possible to a standard Webpack setup, so you can run webpack and webpack-dev-server in the usual way. For example, using yarn you can build:

    $ yarn webpack

or run the dev server:

    $ yarn webpack-dev-server

Rails will proxy requests to any running Webpack dev server

## Configuration

Frails is built to be as simple as possible, so has very few configuration options. But if you really must change the defaults, just add any of the following config options by adding to `config/application.rb` or and/any of the environment initialzers at `config/environment`.

For example:

```ruby
Rails.application.configure do
  config.frails.dev_server_port = 3035
end
```

Of course, if you do change any of these options, be sure to modify your Webpack config accordingly.

### Options

  - `dev_server_port` - The HTTP port that Rails will proxy asset requests to. (default: `8080`)
  - `dev_server_host` - The HTTP host that Rails will proxy asset requests to. (default: `localhost`)
  - `public_output_path` - The public path where Webpack will output its build to, relative to your app's `/public` directory. (default: `/assets`)

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

## Thanks...

A huge thank you goes out to the peeps behind [Webpacker](https://github.com/rails/webpacker). Frails has borrowed heavily from Webpacker, particularly for the dev server proxy and minifest code. üôè
