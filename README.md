# Frails == Modern Front End on Rails

Frails is a modern asset pipeline for [Rails](https://rubyonrails.org), built on [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). Its aims are:

  - Follow convention over configuration as much as possible.
  - Tight integration with Rails, without tying you up in knots.
  - Full Webpack control without fighting with the likes of Webpacker.
  - Embrace modern front end practises.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'frails'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install frails

## Usage

TODO: Write usage instructions here

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
